Data Science Training Program Assignments 🎓
This repository contains the assignments I completed as part of my Data Science and AI training program at ExcelR. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data science, from data preprocessing and analysis to machine learning model development and evaluation.

📂 Contents
The assignments cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

Basic Statistics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
Handling missing values and outliers
Machine Learning Algorithms

Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM)
Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering, PCA)
Model evaluation and validation techniques
Data Visualization

Visualizing trends and patterns using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other Python libraries.
Chi-Square Tests and Statistical Analysis

Hypothesis testing
Application of statistical methods to real-world datasets
Model Deployment

Deploying machine learning models using Streamlit
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Keras,TensorFlow)
Jupyter Notebooks for executing and documenting code
Streamlit for model deployment
MS Excel for data analysis and visualization
📈 Objective
The goal of these assignments was to develop a strong foundation in data science concepts and apply them to practical problems. These assignments reflect my journey in learning and applying data science techniques to real-world scenarios.
